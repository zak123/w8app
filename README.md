W8 App is an app for business owners (mainly restaraunts) to manage a line of waiting customers with ease. Some of its features:

<ul>
<li>Send an SMS to customers phone when their table is ready, letting them roam the city while waiting on their table, rather than in a crowded lobby</li>
<li>Heat map of who has been waiting the longest, quickly see if a customer is waiting an unacceptable amount of time at a glance. (Inspired by Clear task manager)</li>
<li>Customize the SMS you send by editing your restaraunt name, the amount of grace you give customers to get back to the business, and personalize the flavor text to anything you want</li>
<li>Full iPad support</li>
</ul>
